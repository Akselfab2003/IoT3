# IOT 3 Persont√¶ller

# Setup

### Requirements
- docker
- docker-compose
- esp32


# Configuration

IMPORTANT NOTE: The computer running the docker containers and the ESP32 must be on the same network.

### ESP32

before you upload the code to the ESP32, you need to create a file called `env_secrets.ini` in the `ESP32_Project\IOT3` directory. this file should contain the following information:
```ini
build_flags = 
    -D WIFI_SSID=\"${WIFI_SSID}\"
    -D WIFI_PASS=\"${WIFI_PASS}\"
```
where the `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASS` are the name and password of your wifi network.

### Docker

We use docker to run the MQTT broker to communicate between the ESP32 and the web application.
To run the docker compose file you need to run the following command
```bash 
docker compose -f 'Services\docker-compose.yaml' up -d --build 
```
